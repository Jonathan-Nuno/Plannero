## About the Project

- For people who are passionate about creating new and interesting projects, keeping track of everything can be a real pain. We aimed to develop a site that would make that task a lot easier. With Plannero, you will never have to stress about organizing your projects ever again. 

## Usage

- Plannero allows you to register and log into a personal account or to test out the site by logging in as a guest. Once in, you will have the ability to create a new project, view your projects filtered by status, view details for an existing project, update an existing project, and delete a project.
